    "## Step2 with ErgoSCF\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to compute NACs along the pre-computed MD trajectories using ErgoSCF code \n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider several options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Internal diagonalization, restricted](#case-1)  \n",
    "2. [Internal diagonalization, unrestricted](#case-2)\n",
    "3. [Direct MO, restricted](#case-3)\n",
    "4. [Direct MO, unrestricted](#case-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Internal Diagonalization approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we would run SCF calculations until we reach its convergence. \n",
    "We then read the last - converged - Fock matrix and diagonalize it. \n",
    "As a result of the diagonalization, we obtain both orbital energies and MOs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Direct MO approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, both MOs and orbital energies are produced by ErgoSCF\n",
    "We simply read and use them.\n",
    "Internally, this is done via a projection algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now (analyze the output of this tutorial), it seems that the two approaches may give somewhat different\n",
    "orbital energies and NACs. This happens for some of the orbitals, but not for all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can observe that the two approaches may lead to different degree of the state (orbital) reordering \n",
    "problem - in this example, the reordering with the first method (internal diagonalization) is of smaller issue than in \n",
    "the second method (direct MO)"
