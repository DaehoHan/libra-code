This is the main page of the computational chemistry methodology discovery library, Libra

The autogenerated docs can be found here:

Due to the increased volume of technical questions about installing and using the 
Libra, Libra-X, Pyxaid and Pyxaid2 codes, I have decided to create a convenient public forum 
for all users with the intent:

a) to share my replies with not only a single user that have a trouble, but also other
potential users who may found that information useful;
b) so that the users/developers who have had some experience with the code would be able to share their
knowledge and skills with others;

Among different platforms I found that the Google Group Forum is perhaps the best option.
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quantum-dynamics-hub

So, since Aug. 31, 2017, please post your questions about Libra, Libra-X, Pyxaid, or Pyxaid2 there.

This is only a test practice, I don't know how well it'll go, but lets try it. If you have ideas and suggestions for 
a better forum platform, please email me.
