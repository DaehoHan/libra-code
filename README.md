# Libra

This is the main page of the computational chemistry methodology discovery library, Libra
The program website is [here](https://quantum-dynamics-hub.github.io/libra/index.html)

## Info

More:

* [How to install](https://quantum-dynamics-hub.github.io/libra/installation.html)
* [Numerous examples](/tests)
* [Tutorials](https://quantum-dynamics-hub.github.io/libra/tutorials.html)
* [Autogenerated Documentation](https://quantum-dynamics-hub.github.io/libra-code/)


Due to the increased volume of technical questions about installing and using the 
Libra, Libra-X, Pyxaid and Pyxaid2 codes, I have decided to create a convenient 
[public forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quantum-dynamics-hub)
for all users with the intent:

 - to share my replies with not only a single user that have a trouble, but also other
   potential users who may found that information useful;

 - so that the users/developers who have had some experience with the code would be able to share their
   knowledge and skills with others;
